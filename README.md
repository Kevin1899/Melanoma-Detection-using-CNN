# Project Name
> Melanoma Detection using CNN


## Table of Contents
* Importing libraries
* Mount to Drive
* Create Train and Validation set using keras from dataset
* Visualize dataset
* Create model
* Compile model
* Train model
* visualize accuracy and losses
* Use augmentation and follow above all steps
* Use class Rebalancing and follow all steps


## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Conclusions
- By normal cnn model(Model-1),the model is getting overfitted
- To overcome overfitting issue,we used batch normalization,dropout layers,augmentation and class imbalancing

## Technologies Used
- Tensorflow, Keras  -->For CNN
- Seaborn,Matplotlib -->For Data Visualization
